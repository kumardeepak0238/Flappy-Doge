# Flappy-Doge
1. Introduction We try to bring the popular game Flappy Bird, which is originally on Android platform, to the FPGA board. This game is a side-scroller where the player controls a bird, attempting to fly between columns of pipes without hitting them. The objective was to direct a flying doge, named "Flappy Doge‚Äù, who moves continuously to the right, between sets of Mario-like pipes. If the player touches the pipes, they lose. Doge briefly flaps upward each time that the player click the mouse, if the mouse is not clicked, Doge falls because of gravity. Each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single point, with medals awarded for the score at the end of the game.
